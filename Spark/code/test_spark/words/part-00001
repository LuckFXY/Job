Endogenous
glycopeptides
are
significant
biomarkers
for
many
diseases,
such
as
Alzheimer's
disease
and
cancer.
However,
their
separation
is
always
plagued
by
the
low
abundance
of
glycopeptides
(generally
10
to
500
pg/mL
in
biofluids)
and
the
high
abundance
of
background
molecules
(such
as
proteins
and
non-glycopeptides)
in
complex
biofluids.


Researchers
from
the
Technical
Institute
of
Physics
and
Chemistry
(TIPC)
of
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
recently
developed
an
emulsion
interfacial
polymerization
approach
to
synthesize
polymer
particles
with
hydrophilic-hydrophobic
heterostructured
surfaces
and
two-dimensional
Janus
film
actuators.


On
the
basis
of
previous
studies,
the
researchers
recently
synthesized
a
series
of
polymer
particles
with
hydrophilic-hydrophobic
heterostructured
nanopores
by
emulsion
interfacial
polymerization,
realizing
efficient
separation
of
low-abundance
glycopeptides
from
high-abundance
proteins
and
non-glycopeptides.


The
efficient
separation
is
achieved
by
allowing
solvent-dependent
local
adsorption
of
biomolecules
on
the
heterostructured
surface
inside
the
nanopores
via
switching
the
solvent
polarity.
