Chinese researchers have developed interfacially polymerized porous polymer particles for low- abundance glycopeptide separation. These polymer particles – with hydrophilic-hydrophobic heterostructured nanopores – can separate low-abundance glycopeptides from complex biological samples with high-abundance background molecules efficiently. 

Results were published in the journal Advanced Materials in an article entitled "Interfacially Polymerized Particles with Heterostructured Nanopores for Glycopeptide Separation." 

Qualitative/quantitative analyses of low-abundance biomolecules from complex biofluids are critical in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. For example, glycosylated Aβ peptide can help identify Alzheimer's disease and circulating tumor DNA can help identify cancer. 

Porous polymer materials have been extensively used for separation. However, most existing porous polymer materials have homogeneous compositions or pores. As a result, efficiently and specifically separating subsets of low-abundance biomolecules from complex samples (such as serum and plasma) is a great challenge. Although recent molecule-level surface modification efforts for these homogeneous porous polymer materials have demonstrated enhanced separation specificity, unspecific adsorption of high-abundance background molecules still exists.
